# Priorities during Development

This is the hierarchy of priorities during development and debugging, ordered from highest priority to lowest priority.

1. Ensure presence of precise, reproducing unit or integration tests (preferrably unit tests).
   - These tests help us estimate if we're making progress.
   - Prefer precise names describing exactly what's under test.
2. Ensure code is robust and does not break or produce bugs easily.
   - We are building developer tools that many developers need to rely on for production code.
3. Ensure log output provides helpful information.
   - If in doubt, add one more log statement with an appropriate log level (typically trace or debug).
4. Ensure future-proof fixes.
   - If possible come up with a generic fix for any given solution such that it works for all likely use cases.
   - Try to produce re-usable code and re-use it wherever it makes sense.
   - Prefer expanding AST nodes or compiler state with in-memory calculations over ad-hoc calculations if it makes sense.
5. Speed of coming up with a fix.
   - If really necessary, come up with a pinpoint fix for a specific situation, but only if it actually helps us find a future-proof fix.

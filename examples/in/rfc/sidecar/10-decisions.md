# Sidecar Integration Decision Document

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the strategic decisions for implementing Forst sidecar integration, enabling gradual adoption of Forst within existing TypeScript backends while maintaining zero-downtime tolerance and prioritizing developer experience over raw performance.

## Core Strategic Decisions

### **1. MVP-First Approach**

- **Rapid Prototyping**: Prioritize getting a working solution quickly over comprehensive feature completeness
- **Incremental Development**: Start with basic HTTP transport and expand to advanced features later
- **Streaming Architecture**: Design for future streaming capabilities without implementing them in MVP

### **2. Developer Experience Priority**

- **TypeScript Familiarity**: Prioritize "feels like TypeScript" over leveraging Go ecosystem features
- **Zero-Config Installation**: NPM package should automatically download and install Forst compiler
- **Seamless Integration**: Minimize cognitive overhead for developers adopting Forst

### **3. Reliability Over Performance**

- **Circuit Breakers**: Implement fallback mechanisms before optimizing for maximum performance
- **Graceful Degradation**: Ensure system remains functional even when sidecar fails
- **Production Safety**: Zero tolerance for downtime requires robust error handling

## Technical Architecture Decisions

### **4. Transport Strategy**

- **HTTP-First Approach**: Use HTTP transport for initial adoption due to easier debugging and familiar tooling
- **Future IPC Support**: Architect for IPC transport but defer implementation until after MVP validation
- **Performance Threshold**: Accept sidecar complexity only if it provides 10x performance gains

### **5. Development Workflow**

- **Hot Reloading**: Implement live reloading that works even when Forst compilation fails
- **File Watching**: Leverage existing Forst compiler file watching capabilities
- **Simple Dev Server**: HTTP development server that runs Forst compiler and watches files

### **6. Type System Integration**

- **Basic Type Generation**: Start with fundamental type generation, expand to advanced features later
- **Seamless Type Sharing**: Shared types between TypeScript and Forst should be as seamless as possible
- **Compile-Time Safety**: Prevent version mismatches between TypeScript and Forst code at compile time

## Implementation Decisions

### **7. MVP Feature Set**

- **NPM Package**: Downloads and installs Forst compiler automatically on installation
- **HTTP Dev Server**: Simple development server that runs Forst compiler with file watching
- **Node.js Client**: Client library that communicates with sidecar/HTTP dev server
- **Basic Type Generation**: Fundamental TypeScript type generation from Forst code
- **Raw Code Deployment**: Ship raw Forst code to production and compile there (defer compilation optimization)

### **8. Production Operations**

- **Sidecar Management**: Accept manual sidecar startup commands for initial MVP
- **Process Recovery**: Implement restart and retry mechanisms for sidecar failures
- **User-Defined Fallbacks**: Let users decide fallback strategy for persistent failures
- **Compilation Failures**: Break and show output if Forst compilation fails, but maintain hot reloading

### **9. Migration Strategy**

- **Explicit Route Selection**: Developers explicitly choose which routes to migrate
- **Gradual Migration**: Support replacing one route at a time without extra manual setup
- **Automatic Route Detection**: `@forst/cli` should automatically detect and suggest high-impact routes
- **Easy Rollback**: Uninstalling NPM package and removing Forst files should suffice for rollback

## Future Considerations

### **10. Observability and Monitoring**

- **Unified Observability**: Metrics and logs should appear as if it's a single application
- **Distributed Tracing**: Handle tracing across TypeScript-Forst boundary seamlessly
- **Observability Complexity**: Make sidecar observable without adding operational complexity

### **11. Advanced Features**

- **TypeScript Tooling**: Integrate with existing TypeScript tooling (deferred from MVP)
- **Streaming Support**: Architect for future streaming capabilities without current implementation
- **IPC Transport**: Design for future IPC transport implementation
- **Advanced Type Generation**: Expand type generation capabilities based on user feedback

## Risk Mitigation

### **12. Failure Scenarios**

- **Sidecar Crashes**: Implement automatic restart with exponential backoff
- **Compilation Failures**: Maintain development workflow even when compilation fails
- **Version Mismatches**: Prevent at compile time where possible
- **Performance Degradation**: Implement circuit breakers to fall back to TypeScript

### **13. Adoption Barriers**

- **Learning Curve**: Prioritize familiar TypeScript patterns over Go-specific features
- **Tooling Integration**: Defer complex tooling integration until after MVP validation
- **Production Readiness**: Start with development-friendly features, expand to production features

## Success Metrics

### **14. Technical Metrics**

- **Zero Downtime**: No production outages due to sidecar integration
- **Performance Gains**: Achieve 10x performance improvement for migrated routes
- **Developer Velocity**: Maintain or improve development speed for teams adopting Forst

### **15. Adoption Metrics**

- **Easy Onboarding**: Teams can adopt Forst with minimal configuration
- **Gradual Migration**: Successful migration of individual routes without system-wide changes
- **Rollback Success**: Teams can easily rollback Forst adoption if needed

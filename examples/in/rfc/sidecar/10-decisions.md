# Forst Sidecar Integration: Strategic Decision Document

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the strategic framework for implementing Forst sidecar integration within existing TypeScript backend applications. The initiative aims to enable gradual adoption of Forst while maintaining zero-downtime tolerance and prioritizing developer experience over raw performance optimization.

**Key Objectives:**

- Enable seamless integration of Forst within TypeScript applications
- Provide 10x performance improvements for migrated routes
- Maintain zero-downtime tolerance in production environments
- Minimize developer friction during adoption

## Strategic Framework

### 1. MVP-First Development Approach

**Rationale:** Rapid market validation requires a working solution over comprehensive feature completeness.

**Decisions:**

- **Rapid Prototyping Priority**: Focus on functional implementation over feature completeness
- **Incremental Architecture**: Implement basic HTTP transport with clear expansion pathways
- **Future-Ready Design**: Architect for streaming capabilities without current implementation
- **Iterative Development**: Deploy minimal viable product and expand based on user feedback

### 2. Developer Experience Optimization

**Rationale:** Adoption success depends on minimizing cognitive overhead and maintaining familiar workflows.

**Decisions:**

- **TypeScript Familiarity**: Prioritize familiar TypeScript patterns over Go ecosystem features
- **Zero-Configuration Installation**: NPM package should automatically provision Forst compiler
- **Seamless Integration**: Minimize developer friction during initial adoption phase
- **Gradual Learning Curve**: Enable adoption without requiring Go expertise

### 3. Reliability-First Architecture

**Rationale:** Production environments require robust error handling before performance optimization.

**Decisions:**

- **Circuit Breaker Implementation**: Deploy fallback mechanisms before performance optimization
- **Graceful Degradation**: Ensure system functionality during sidecar failures
- **Production Safety**: Implement zero-downtime tolerance through robust error handling
- **Failure Isolation**: Prevent sidecar issues from affecting TypeScript application stability

## Technical Architecture Decisions

### 4. Transport Layer Strategy

**Rationale:** HTTP transport provides familiar debugging and tooling while enabling future optimization.

**Decisions:**

- **HTTP-First Implementation**: Utilize HTTP transport for initial adoption and debugging
- **Future IPC Architecture**: Design for IPC transport with deferred implementation
- **Performance Threshold**: Accept sidecar complexity only with 10x performance gains
- **Tooling Compatibility**: Leverage existing HTTP debugging and monitoring tools

### 5. Development Workflow Design

**Rationale:** Developer productivity requires seamless integration with existing workflows.

**Decisions:**

- **Hot Reloading Resilience**: Maintain development workflow during Forst compilation failures
- **File Watching Integration**: Leverage existing Forst compiler file monitoring capabilities
- **Simple Development Server**: Implement HTTP development server with compiler integration
- **Error Transparency**: Surface compilation errors without disrupting development flow

### 6. Type System Integration Strategy

**Rationale:** Seamless type sharing between languages is critical for adoption success.

**Decisions:**

- **Basic Type Generation**: Implement fundamental type generation with expansion pathways
- **Seamless Type Sharing**: Enable transparent type sharing between TypeScript and Forst
- **Compile-Time Safety**: Prevent version mismatches through compile-time validation
- **Constraint Mapping**: Map Forst constraints to TypeScript-compatible types

## Implementation Specifications

### 7. MVP Feature Requirements

**Core Components:**

- **NPM Package Integration**: Automatic Forst compiler download and installation
- **HTTP Development Server**: Simple server with compiler and file watching integration
- **Node.js Client Library**: Communication layer for sidecar/HTTP server interaction
- **Basic Type Generation**: Fundamental TypeScript type generation from Forst code
- **Raw Code Deployment**: Ship Forst source to production with runtime compilation

### 8. Production Operations Framework

**Operational Decisions:**

- **Manual Sidecar Management**: Accept manual startup commands for initial MVP
- **Process Recovery Mechanisms**: Implement restart and retry logic for sidecar failures
- **User-Defined Fallbacks**: Enable custom fallback strategies for persistent failures
- **Compilation Failure Handling**: Maintain hot reloading during compilation failures

### 9. Migration Strategy Implementation

**Adoption Framework:**

- **Explicit Route Selection**: Enable developers to choose specific routes for migration
- **Gradual Migration Support**: Facilitate one-route-at-a-time migration without manual setup
- **Automatic Route Detection**: Implement intelligent detection of high-impact routes
- **Simplified Rollback**: Enable easy rollback through NPM package removal

## Critical Implementation Decisions

### 10. Error Handling Architecture

**Error Management Strategy:**

- **Child Process Integration**: Deploy Forst sidecar as child process within TypeScript application
- **Compilation Error Isolation**: Isolate Forst compilation errors unless type conflicts occur
- **Runtime Error Transparency**: Maintain native Forst error presentation without TypeScript wrapping
- **Error Type Compatibility**: Generate TypeScript-compatible errors with unique Forst codes

### 11. Type Safety Boundary Management

**Type System Decisions:**

- **Type Mismatch Handling**: Accept TypeScript server failures on incompatible types
- **Constraint Mapping Strategy**: Map Forst constraints to broader TypeScript types with JSDoc documentation
- **Type Generation Approach**: Prefer broader TypeScript types over exact constraint matches
- **Forst-Specific Type Handling**: Map to valid TypeScript types or utilize `any` with comprehensive documentation

### 12. Production Deployment Architecture

**Deployment Strategy:**

- **Integrated Deployment Model**: Deploy sidecar as integrated child process within TypeScript application
- **Development Server Pattern**: Utilize development server deployment pattern with future production optimization
- **Automatic Compilation**: Implement automatic compilation in production environments
- **Infrastructure Abstraction**: Defer scaling and infrastructure considerations for MVP phase

## Future Considerations

### 13. Observability and Monitoring

**Monitoring Strategy:**

- **Unified Observability**: Present metrics and logs as single application
- **Distributed Tracing**: Implement seamless tracing across TypeScript-Forst boundary
- **Operational Simplicity**: Minimize observability complexity for operational teams

### 14. Advanced Feature Roadmap

**Future Enhancements:**

- **TypeScript Tooling Integration**: Defer complex tooling integration until post-MVP validation
- **Streaming Support**: Architect for future streaming capabilities without current implementation
- **IPC Transport**: Design for future IPC transport implementation
- **Advanced Type Generation**: Expand type generation based on user feedback and requirements

## Risk Mitigation Framework

### 15. Failure Scenario Management

**Risk Mitigation Strategies:**

- **Sidecar Crash Recovery**: Implement automatic restart with exponential backoff
- **Compilation Failure Resilience**: Maintain development workflow during compilation failures
- **Version Mismatch Prevention**: Implement compile-time version validation
- **Performance Degradation Protection**: Deploy circuit breakers for TypeScript fallback

### 16. Adoption Barrier Reduction

**Adoption Strategy:**

- **Learning Curve Minimization**: Prioritize familiar TypeScript patterns over Go-specific features
- **Tooling Integration Deferral**: Postpone complex tooling integration until MVP validation
- **Production Readiness Phasing**: Begin with development-friendly features, expand to production capabilities

## Success Metrics and Validation

# Trade-offs and Recommendations

## Drawbacks

### HTTP Transport Drawbacks

1. **Performance overhead**: ~2ms latency per call vs ~0.2ms for IPC
2. **Memory overhead**: JSON serialization/deserialization
3. **Network complexity**: Connection pooling, retry logic, error handling
4. **Port management**: Potential port conflicts in development

### IPC Transport Drawbacks

1. **Platform limitations**: Unix domain sockets vs Windows named pipes
2. **Debugging complexity**: Harder to inspect with standard tools
3. **Deployment complexity**: Socket file permissions, cleanup
4. **Scaling limitations**: Limited to single machine

### General Drawbacks

1. **Additional complexity**: Introduces transport layer between TypeScript and business logic
2. **Deployment overhead**: Requires Go binaries in production
3. **Learning curve**: Teams need to learn Forst syntax for new implementations
4. **Tooling gaps**: Limited debugging and monitoring tools for IPC

## Recommendations

### When to Use IPC

- **Development environments**: Faster iteration, no port conflicts
- **High-frequency operations**: >1000 calls/second
- **Single-machine deployments**: Microservices, serverless functions
- **Performance-critical paths**: Real-time processing, data pipelines

### When to Use HTTP

- **Production deployments**: Standard observability and monitoring
- **Multi-service architectures**: Load balancers, service mesh
- **Debugging scenarios**: Easy inspection with curl, Postman
- **Cross-platform compatibility**: Windows, macOS, Linux
- **Containerized environments**: Docker, Kubernetes sidecars

### Migration Strategy

1. **Start with HTTP**: Easy debugging and familiar patterns
2. **Profile performance**: Identify bottlenecks and high-frequency calls
3. **Migrate to IPC**: Move performance-critical functions to IPC
4. **Monitor and optimize**: Use metrics to guide further optimization

## Rationale and alternatives

### Alternative Approaches

1. **Complete rewrite**: Rewrite entire applications in Go

   - Drawback: High risk and time investment
   - Drawback: Disrupts development workflow

2. **Microservices**: Split into separate Go services

   - Drawback: Complex deployment and orchestration
   - Drawback: Network overhead between services

3. **WebAssembly**: Compile Go to WASM
   - Drawback: Limited Go standard library support
   - Drawback: Larger binary sizes

### Why Sidecar Integration

The sidecar approach provides the best balance of:

1. **Gradual adoption**: Replace routes incrementally
2. **Performance benefits**: Leverages Go's efficiency
3. **Development experience**: Maintains TypeScript workflow
4. **Risk mitigation**: Low-risk migration path
5. **Immediate value**: Solve performance issues quickly

### Prior Art

This approach is inspired by:

1. **Kubernetes sidecars**: Independent containers that enhance main applications
2. **Service mesh patterns**: Lightweight proxies for service communication
3. **Gradual migration strategies**: Incremental system improvements
4. **Performance optimization**: Targeted improvements for bottlenecks

## Conclusion

The sidecar integration approach provides a practical solution for solving TypeScript backend performance issues through gradual adoption of Forst implementations. By enabling teams to replace problematic routes incrementally, this approach allows immediate performance improvements without disrupting existing development workflows.

The zero-config setup and automatic type generation make it easy for teams to start solving performance bottlenecks immediately, while the hybrid transport architecture ensures compatibility with existing deployment and monitoring infrastructure.

This approach aligns with Forst's goal of bringing Go's performance to TypeScript applications while providing a practical migration path that teams can adopt without risk.

## Future Considerations

### Advanced Transport Options

1. **gRPC**: For high-performance RPC communication
2. **WebSockets**: For real-time bidirectional communication
3. **Shared Memory**: For maximum performance in single-machine deployments
4. **Message Queues**: For asynchronous processing patterns

### Integration Patterns

1. **Database Integration**: Direct database connections from Go
2. **Caching Layers**: Redis/Memcached integration
3. **External APIs**: HTTP client libraries in Go
4. **File I/O**: Efficient file processing in Go

### Monitoring and Observability

1. **Distributed Tracing**: OpenTelemetry integration
2. **Metrics Collection**: Prometheus/Grafana dashboards
3. **Logging**: Structured logging with correlation IDs
4. **Health Checks**: Comprehensive health monitoring

### Security Considerations

1. **Authentication**: JWT validation in Go
2. **Authorization**: Role-based access control
3. **Input Validation**: Comprehensive validation in Forst
4. **Rate Limiting**: Request throttling and protection

### Performance Optimization

1. **Connection Pooling**: Efficient resource management
2. **Caching Strategies**: Multi-level caching
3. **Load Balancing**: Intelligent request distribution
4. **Auto-scaling**: Dynamic resource allocation

The sidecar integration represents a pragmatic approach to solving real-world performance problems while maintaining developer productivity and system reliability.
